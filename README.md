# vector-commands
Putting together all commands for vector to be run on alexa with a homebridge server with cmdswitch2

Usage: commands that allow you to have interactions with anki vector using commands from your own server

Setup: download python file, install and setup homebridge (https://homebridge.io/), add the cmdswitch2 extension on the homebridge page (https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-cmdswitch2), add the homebridge-alexa plugin to homebridge (https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-alexa), configure cmdswitch2 to run specified command when you say alexa turn on [command], done.

Also: make sure to get an open weather api key, edit the city and key and the date you got vector which can be found in the vector app.

I will at some point learn how to better style and format readmes, for now this is what it is and probaly will be for a while.
